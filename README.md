# Gator Tracker

## Application Description
This full-stack website is a gator sighting tracker. All who visit the site are able to see posts of gator sightings with a map and comments on the home page. To post or comment a user must sign in. Users can either login or sign up with a name, username, email, and password. Upon signing in, they can see the dashboard where they can add a new post or edit or delete an existing one and be brought back to a refreshed dashboard. They can also comment on posts once logged in. 

## Challenge Description
This challenge began by creating a database, seed data, and models for mysql. Then backend api routes for get/post/put/delete were created and tested in insomnia. Then routes were created for rendering the front end webpages via handlebars. Finally these were connected to the handlebar html pages with public JavaScript files for button handling and css styling which were able to be viewed on localhost and are deployed to Heroku. 

## User Story

```
